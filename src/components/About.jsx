				My name is Sofia, I'm a curious frontend developer with a background as
				a visual designer. Right now I'm on the lookout for an internship far
				the fall 2021. React is one of my favourite framworks so far. The focus
				in my studies are mainly frontend but I can see myself going into a more
				fullstack position eventually. Coding is amazing.
